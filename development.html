            <h4>Inventing on Principles</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Presentation by Bret Victor</p>
            <p>Date: 31.October.2023</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
              <em>Inventing on Principle</em> is a talk by Bret Victor in which he elaborates on the idea that invention should be driven by a deep foundational principle â€” an unwavering belief that guides an individual's work.
              <br>
              Imagine, if you will, a compass in the hands of an explorer. 
              While the terrain they navigate is unknown and fraught with challenges, the compass provides a reliable direction, ensuring that every step taken aligns with a predetermined path. 
              Similarly, Bret Victor argues that innovators and creators need such a compass in the form of a guiding principle. 
              This principle becomes the core belief, fueling every innovation or invention they produce.
              <br>
              One of Victor's foundational principles is that creators should have an immediate and intimate connection with what they create. 
              To elaborate, think of a painter who, with every brushstroke on canvas, sees the colors transform before their eyes. 
              There's no delay; there's immediate feedback. Now, apply this to the world of software development. 
              Traditionally, writing code is like painting blindfolded. 
              Developers write lines of complex code and then run the program to see if it works. 
              There's a delay, often leading to inefficiencies and frustration.
              <br>
              James Webb Young, an advertising executive, later distilled the creative process into five stages in 1940. 
              His model proposes that innovative thinking isn't about conjuring something entirely new but about uniquely combining existing elements. 
              Central to this is the ability to discern relationships between disparate ideas. The stages are:</p>
              <br>
              <p>Using this principle, Victor showcases several examples:</p>
              <br>
              <p>    Code and Output Side-by-Side: Imagine a split-screen setup. On one side, you have the code you're writing, and on the other, you see its real-time execution. As you modify the code, the changes manifest instantly. This not only saves time but also offers a deeper understanding of how changes affect outcomes.</p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Dynamic Drawing Tool: Victor demos a tool where, as you draw a design or sketch, parameters (like angles, lengths) can be adjusted in real-time. If drawing a tree, for instance, changing a parameter could instantly show more branches, adjust their angle, or change their length.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                Game Parameter Adjustment: For game developers, Victor presents a platform where they can play a game and adjust parameters (like gravity, jump height, speed) in real-time. It's like playing a video game and having a slider that lets you adjust the game's physics on-the-fly.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                All these examples resonate with his principle of immediate feedback and connectivity between creation and creator.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                But beyond these applications, Victor's broader message is about recognizing one's guiding principle and committing to it. Just as civil rights leaders were driven by deep principles about equality and justice, inventors should also be motivated by principles that they believe can change the world. It's not about inventing for the sake of invention but about ensuring that every creation aligns with a deeper purpose.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p>
                In conclusion, Bret Victor's "Inventing on Principle" is a clarion call for purpose-driven innovation. Just as a compass guides an explorer, a deep-rooted principle should guide inventors. Through immediate feedback tools, Victor showcases the transformative power of staying true to one's guiding principle, urging all creators to find and commit to theirs.
