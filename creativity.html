        <h4>A More Creative Brain</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Written by James Clear</p>

          The essence of creative thinking is the ability to connect old ideas in novel ways. 
          This article stresses the universality of the creative process and underscores its significance in addressing everyday challenges. 
          Mastering creative thinking can dramatically benefit personal and professional problem-solving.
          <br>
          A historic illustration of this process is the predicament newspapers faced in the 1870s. 
          Readers sought more photographs, but printing these images swiftly and economically was an obstacle. 
          Traditional methods like photoengraving were both slow and costly. The solution came from Frederic Eugene Ives, a pioneer in photography. 
          His journey to revolutionize the printing technique provides a practical model of the creative process.
          <br>
          Ives' story starts in Ithaca, New York, as a printerâ€™s apprentice. 
          His experiences in the printing realm and later, managing a photographic lab at Cornell University, immersed him in the challenges of photography and printing. One morning in 1881, after considerable reflection on a better printing method, Ives experienced a sudden revelation about a new technique. 
          This led to the development of the "halftone printing" method, a breakthrough that reduced image printing costs fifteen-fold and remained the industry standard for nearly eight decades.
          <br>
          James Webb Young, an advertising executive, later distilled the creative process into five stages in 1940. 
          His model proposes that innovative thinking isn't about conjuring something entirely new but about uniquely combining existing elements. 
          Central to this is the ability to discern relationships between disparate ideas. The stages are:</p>
          <br>
        <ul>
          <li>gather new Material:</li>
          <p>Engage in both task-specific and general learning. Absorb a broad range of concepts.</p>
          <li>mentally process this information:</li>
          <p>Meticulously examine and ponder over the accumulated knowledge, playing around with various idea combinations.</p>
          <li>step back from the problem:</li>
          <p>Deliberately divert your attention from the challenge, engaging in other stimulating activities.</p>
          <li>wait for an insight or solution:</li>
          <p>After a break, insights will resurface spontaneously, often with renewed vigor.</p>
          <li>refine the idea based on feedback:</li>
          <p>Once conceived, expose the idea to external criticism and evolve it accordingly.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>In summary, creativity is about linking existing concepts in innovative ways.
